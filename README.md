### The Legend of the Rabbit and the Moon 🐰🌙

Quetzalcoatl, the great and good god, went to travel the world once as a man. As he had walked all day, in the late afternoon he felt tired and hungry. But he kept walking and walking, until the stars began to shine and the moon leaned out in the heavens. Then he sat down on the edge of the road, and was resting there, when he saw a bunny who had gone out to dinner.

– What are you eating? – He asked.  
– I'm eating grass. Do you want some?  
– Thanks, but I don't eat grass.  
– What are you going to do then?  
– Maybe die, from starvation and thirst.

Then the bunny approached him and said.  
– Look, I'm just a bunny, but if you're hungry, eat me, I'm here.

Then the god stroked the bunny and said:  
– Maybe you are nothing but a bunny, but everyone, forever, has to remember you.

And he raised it high, very high, up to the moon, where the figure of the rabbit was stamped. Then the god brought him down to earth and said: "There you have your portrait in light, for all men and for all times."
